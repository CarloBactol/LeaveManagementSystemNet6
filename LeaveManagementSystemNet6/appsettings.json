// Note:
// Due to a change in Entity Framework Core 7, you will get the following error when attempting to scaffold.
// A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)

//Solution:
//Add Encrypt=False to the connection string as seen below:
//'Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb; Database=LeaveManagementNet6; Trusted_Connection=true; MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Encrypt=False'
